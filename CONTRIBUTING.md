# Contributing to AUMI

## Purpose of This Repository

AUMI is a cohesive human-centred AI responsibility framework that reflects real-world system design, evaluation, and governance experience.

This repository is published as a **reference framework**, not a general-purpose open-source toolkit.

As such, contributions are curated to preserve conceptual integrity and governance coherence.

---

## What Contributions Are Welcome

We welcome contributions that:

- Clarify language or structure  
- Improve readability and documentation memorability  
- Identify inconsistencies or gaps in the framework  
- Propose extensions aligned with AUMI’s responsibility model  
- Share evidence-backed governance insights via discussion  

All feedback should strengthen coherence, not expand scope arbitrarily.

---

## What Contributions Are Not Accepted

The following will generally not be accepted:

- Feature-style additions without governance justification  
- Tooling, SDKs, or implementation-specific code  
- Opinionated rewrites that change framework intent  
- Marketing, branding, or promotional content  
- Contributions that fragment ownership or responsibility models  

AUMI is intentionally **not** a crowd-sourced framework.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue

Before proposing changes, open an issue describing:

- The concern or proposal  
- Which AUMI layer does it affects  
- Why does it improve responsibility or clarity  

### 2. Substantial Changes

For significant proposals, please:

- Provide rationale aligned with existing AUMI principles  
- Explain introduced trade-offs  
- Describe governance implications  

Pull requests may be requested after discussion.

## Design Integrity

All accepted contributions must:

- Preserve human-centred responsibility as the primary goal  
- Align with the full AUMI lifecycle (v0.9 → v5.0)  
- Avoid introducing role ambiguity or governance gaps  

Responsibility coherence takes priority over expansion.

## Disclosure

This public repository intentionally omits:

- Internal SOPs  
- Evaluation thresholds  
- Operational runbooks  
- Incident logs  

References to such materials should remain abstract.

## Code of Conduct

A professional, respectful discussion is expected.

This repository is intended for:

- AI practitioners  
- Product leaders  
- Governance specialists  
- Systems thinkers operating in real-world constraints  

Harassment, bad-faith participation, or disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated.

## Final Note

AUMI reflects a deliberate responsibility model.

Contributions are welcomed when they strengthen the system,  
not when they dilute ownership or accountability.
