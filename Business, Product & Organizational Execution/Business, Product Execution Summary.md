# AUMI v5 - Business, Product & Organizational Execution

## What This Document Is

AUMI v5 defines the execution layer of the AUMI framework.

It governs how human-centred AI responsibility is embedded into business strategy, product execution, and organisational decision-making, especially under real-world pressure such as growth targets, deadlines, and scale.

This layer turns AUMI from a framework into an operating model.

## Why v5 Exists

Many AI organisations fail after building technically capable and behaviourally responsible systems.

Common breakdowns include:

- Growth incentives override safety and trust  
- Roadmaps optimised for speed rather than readiness  
- Unclear ownership of AI behaviour decisions  
- Evaluation findings were ignored under delivery pressure  
- Responsibility eroding as teams and products scale  

These failures are not caused by missing principles or architecture.  
They are caused by organisational misalignment.

AUMI v5 exists to ensure responsibility survives business reality.

---

## What Problem v5 Addresses

AUMI v5 addresses the execution gap between:

- Responsible AI intent  
- Everyday business and product decisions  

It focuses on failures that arise from:

- Incentive misalignment  
- Fragmented ownership  
- Pressure-driven shortcuts  
- Lack of institutional learning  

Without an execution layer, responsibility becomes symbolic.

---

## What AUMI v5 Is

AUMI v5 is a business and product execution playbook.

It defines how organisations:

- Align responsibility with business value  
- Treat AI behaviour as a product feature  
- Assign clear ownership for AI behaviour decisions  
- Make accountable decisions under pressure  
- Scale trust, accountability, and learning  

AUMI v5 ensures responsibility is economically supported, operationally owned, and culturally reinforced.

---

## What AUMI v5 Is Not

AUMI v5 is not:

- A compliance or legal framework  
- A growth constraint  
- An ethics manifesto  
- A management theory  

It is a practical operating system for teams building and scaling AI products.

---

## Core Principle of v5

AUMI v5 is guided by one principle:

> Responsibility that is not embedded into incentives, ownership, and decision-making will eventually be bypassed.  
> Responsible AI must be designed into how organisations work, not added as oversight.

---

## Structure of AUMI v5

AUMI v5 is composed of five execution-focused modules.

---

### v5.1 - Business Alignment & Value Framing

Defines how responsibility is framed as business value, not cost.

---

### v5.2 - Product Strategy & Roadmap Integration

Defines how AI behaviour and risk are embedded into discovery, prioritisation, and delivery.

---

### v5.3 - Cross-Functional Collaboration Models

Defines how teams collaborate without diffusing accountability.

---

### v5.4 - Operational Decision-Making & Ownership

Defines how AI behaviour decisions are made, owned, documented, and enforced.

---

### v5.5 - Scaling Trust, Accountability & Learning

Defines how responsibility remains durable as products, teams, and organisations scale.

---

## How v5 Fits into the AUMI Framework

AUMI v5 completes the framework by connecting all earlier layers to real execution.

- v0.9 defines responsibility intent  
- v1 defines responsible behaviour  
- v2 enforces behaviour structurally  
- v3 governs long-term human interaction  
- v4 governs behaviour operationally  
- v5 embeds responsibility into organisations  

Without v5, AUMI remains principled but fragile.

---

## Who This Document Is For

AUMI v5 is intended for:

- Founders and executive leadership  
- Product and AI product leaders  
- AI product operations and program managers  
- EvalOps, safety, and governance owners  
- Teams scaling AI systems in production  

It is especially relevant where business pressure intersects with trust risk.

---

## How This Document Should Be Used

AUMI v5 should be used:

- During business and product planning  
- When prioritising AI features and investments  
- During incident reviews and retrospectives  
- When scaling teams or product lines  
- As a shared language across leadership and execution  

If responsibility depends on individual discipline, it will not scale.
