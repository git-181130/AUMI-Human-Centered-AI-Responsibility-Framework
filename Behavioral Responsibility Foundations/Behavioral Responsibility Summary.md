# AUMI v1 — Behavioral Responsibility Foundations

## What This Document Is

AUMI v1 defines the behavioral responsibility baseline for AI systems that interact with humans.

It translates the vision established in AUMI v0.9 into explicit, observable standards for AI behavior, focusing on how AI systems respond, adapt, and remain accountable during human interaction.

This version is **foundational and operational**.  
All later AUMI layers assume v1 compliance.

---

## Why v1 Exists

Many AI systems fail not because they are inaccurate, but because their behavior is misaligned with human context.

Common failures include:

- Correct answers delivered unsafely  
- Refusal-based safety that abandons users  
- Emotional insensitivity during vulnerable moments  
- Overconfidence presented as certainty  
- Inconsistent behavior across similar situations  

AUMI v1 exists to define minimum acceptable behavior for any human-facing AI system.

---

## What Problem v1 Addresses

AUMI v1 addresses the behavior gap between:

- What an AI system outputs  
- How that output affects a human  

It focuses on failures that:

- Pass traditional safety checks  
- Appear compliant with policy  
- But still cause emotional, cognitive, or decision-making harm  

These failures are systemic, not edge cases.

---

## What AUMI v1 Is

AUMI v1 is a behavioral responsibility framework.

It defines how AI systems must:

- Interpret user intent beyond literal prompts  
- Respond with appropriate tone and depth  
- Handle emotional context safely  
- Apply safety through guidance, not silence  
- Remain consistent and predictable over time  
- Be evaluated and held accountable  

AUMI v1 governs how intelligence is expressed, not how intelligence is built.

---

## What AUMI v1 Is Not

AUMI v1 is not:

- A model architecture  
- A content moderation policy  
- A UX writing guide  
- A single safety feature  
- A compliance checklist  

It is a system-level behavioral contract.

---

## Core Principle of v1

AUMI v1 is guided by one principle:

> AI systems interacting with humans must be responsible for the impact of their behavior, not just the correctness of their outputs.

Responsibility is defined by human outcome, not internal confidence.

---

## Structure of AUMI v1

AUMI v1 consists of five tightly scoped components.

---

### v1.0 — Core Responsibility Framework

Defines:

- What responsibility means for AI  
- Boundaries between intelligence and authority  
- Non-negotiable behavioral principles  

---

### v1.1 — Behavioral Protocols

Defines:

- Intent interpretation beyond literal input  
- Emotional awareness without manipulation  
- Tone, depth, and pacing adaptation  
- Supportive redirection instead of refusal  
- Preservation of user agency  

---

### v1.2 — Safety and Red Zone Handling

Defines:

- How high-risk or vulnerable situations are detected  
- De-escalation as a primary response  
- Harm prevention over task completion  
- Escalation to external support when appropriate  

---

### v1.3 — Evaluation and Accountability

Defines:

- How responsible behavior is measured  
- Scenario-based testing and failure classification  
- Ownership of evaluation outcomes  
- Documentation and auditability expectations  

---

### v1.4 — Adaptation, Memory, and Trust

Defines:

- Responsible adaptation over time  
- Ethical memory usage  
- Trust formation, decay, and recovery  
- Prevention of dependency  

---

## How v1 Fits Into the AUMI Framework

AUMI v1 is the behavioral spine of AUMI.

- v0.9 explains why responsibility is needed  
- v1 defines what responsible behavior looks like  
- v2 enforces behavior through architecture  
- v3 governs long-term human companionship  
- v4 evaluates and governs behavior operationally  
- v5 embeds responsibility into business and org execution  

Without v1, later versions lack behavioral integrity.

---

## Who This Document Is For

AUMI v1 is intended for:

- AI product managers and product leaders  
- AI safety and governance teams  
- AI product operations and EvalOps teams  
- Designers and engineers working on human-facing AI  

It is especially relevant for systems positioned as:

- Assistants  
- Advisors  
- Companions  
- Guides  

---

## How This Document Should Be Used

AUMI v1 should be used:

- As a baseline for AI behavior design  
- During evaluation and quality reviews  
- To resolve safety vs helpfulness trade-offs  
- As a prerequisite before scaling AI systems  

Any AI system that fails v1 should not progress to advanced layers.
