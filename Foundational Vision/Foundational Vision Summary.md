# AUMI v0.9 — Foundational Vision

## What This Document Is

AUMI v0.9 is the foundational vision and intent document for the AUMI (Human-Centered AI Responsibility) framework.

It establishes why AUMI exists, what problem it addresses, and the design philosophy that guides all later versions.

This document is intentionally **non-operational**.  
It defines direction, not implementation.

## Why v0.9 Exists

Modern AI systems are increasingly experienced by users as:

- Advisors  
- Companions  
- Guides  
- Decision-support partners  

However, most AI systems are still designed around:

- Correctness  
- Fluency  
- Engagement  

This creates a structural gap between AI capability and AI responsibility.

AUMI v0.9 exists to clearly define that gap and establish responsibility as a **first-class design concern**, not a post-hoc safety layer.

---

## What Problem v0.9 Addresses

v0.9 focuses on a single core problem:

> AI systems can behave “correctly” while still causing long-term human harm.

Examples include:

- Emotionally inappropriate but policy-compliant responses  
- Over-assistance that reduces user agency  
- Reassurance when restraint is required  
- Engagement optimization that increases dependency  

These failures are subtle, cumulative, and rarely captured by traditional safety mechanisms.

---

## What AUMI Is (At a High Level)

AUMI is a human-centered responsibility framework for AI systems.

It defines how AI systems should:

- Interpret human intent and context  
- Modulate tone, depth, and certainty  
- Balance assistance with restraint  
- Preserve user autonomy  
- Avoid emotional and cognitive harm  
- Behave consistently across time  

AUMI governs how intelligence is expressed, not how intelligent a system is.

---

## What AUMI Is Not

AUMI is not:

- An AI model  
- A chatbot persona  
- A content moderation filter  
- A moral or ethical rule engine  
- A replacement for human judgment  

It is a behavioral and operational responsibility layer that sits above models and tools.

---

## Scope of v0.9

AUMI v0.9 is intentionally limited in scope.

It:

- Defines the responsibility problem space  
- Establishes philosophical and ethical intent  
- Aligns early stakeholders  
- Provides direction for structured development  

It does not:

- Define behavioral protocols  
- Specify safety mechanisms  
- Introduce evaluation metrics  
- Describe governance or enforcement  

Those are introduced in later versions.

## How v0.9 Fits Into the AUMI Framework

v0.9 is the foundation for all subsequent AUMI versions.

High-level progression:

- v0.9 — Vision and responsibility intent  
- v1 — Behavioral responsibility and safety foundations  
- v2 — Technical architecture and interaction design  
- v3 — Human companion and emotional integrity  
- v4 — Evaluation operations and safety governance  
- v5 — Business, product, and organizational execution  

Without v0.9, later versions lack philosophical consistency.

## Who This Document Is For

AUMI v0.9 is intended for:

- AI founders and product leaders  
- AI safety and governance teams  
- AI product operations and evaluation teams  
- Researchers and early collaborators  

It is especially relevant for teams building human-facing, conversational, or advisory AI systems.

---

## How This Document Should Be Used

This document should be used:

- To align teams on what “responsible AI behavior” means  
- To ground future design and evaluation decisions  
- As a reference point when trade-offs arise  
- As the philosophical baseline for AUMI adoption  

It is not meant to be used as an implementation guide.
