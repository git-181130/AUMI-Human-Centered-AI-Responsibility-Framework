# AUMI - Human-Centred AI Responsibility Framework

AUMI is a system-level framework for designing, deploying, and governing human-facing AI systems with sustained responsibility.

It addresses a critical gap in modern AI:

> Systems can be technically capable and policy-compliant,  
> yet still cause long-term human, organisational, and trust-related harm.

AUMI transforms responsibility from a policy requirement into an operational capability.

## Why AUMI Matters

As AI systems become:

- Persistent  
- Conversational  
- Emotionally aware  
- Memory-enabled  
- Embedded in daily decisions  

They are no longer experienced as tools — they are experienced as **presences**.

Most existing AI governance focuses on:

- Accuracy  
- Alignment  
- Moderation  
- Compliance  

These approaches fail to manage:

- Emotional dependency  
- Role confusion  
- Long-term trust erosion  
- Post-deployment degradation  
- Organisational pressure on safety  

AUMI exists to close this gap.

## Framework Architecture

AUMI is structured as a five-layer responsibility stack.

### v0.9 - Foundational Vision  
Responsibility, intent and ethical direction

### v1 - Behavioral Responsibility  
Human-facing behaviour standards

### v2 - Technical Architecture  
Structural enforcement mechanisms

### v3 - Human Companion Layer  
Long-term emotional and relational governance

### v4 - EvalOps & Safety Governance  
Operational monitoring and incident control

### v5 - Business & Organizational Execution  
Institutional responsibility at scale

Together, these layers form an end-to-end governance model.
