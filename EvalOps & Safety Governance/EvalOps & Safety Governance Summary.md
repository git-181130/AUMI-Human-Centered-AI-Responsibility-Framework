# AUMI v4 - EvalOps & Safety Governance

## What This Document Is

AUMI v4 defines the Evaluation Operations (EvalOps) and Safety Governance layer of the AUMI framework.

It governs how AI systems are tested, monitored, approved, paused, corrected, and defended once they move beyond design and into real-world operation.

This layer ensures that responsible AI behaviour does not degrade after launch.

---

## Why v4 Exists

Most AI systems fail after deployment, not before it.

Common post-launch failures include:

- Models passing offline tests but failing in production  
- Silent degradation of safety or quality over time  
- Inconsistent behaviour across users or updates  
- Unclear ownership during incidents  
- Missing evidence during audits or reviews  

These failures are rarely caused by bad intent.  
They are caused by missing operational governance.

AUMI v4 exists to make responsibility continuous, measurable, and enforceable.

---

## What Problem v4 Addresses

AUMI v4 addresses the operations gap between:

- Responsible design  
- Responsible execution over time  

It focuses on failures that emerge due to:

- System updates  
- User behaviour shifts  
- Scale and organisational pressure  
- Lack of monitoring and ownership  

Without EvalOps, responsibility silently erodes.

---

## What AUMI v4 Is

AUMI v4 is a production-grade EvalOps and safety governance framework.

It defines:

- What must be evaluated before release  
- How evaluation is repeated and compared  
- How risks are escalated and contained  
- How incidents are investigated and learned from  
- How release decisions are approved and documented  
- How evidence is preserved for accountability  

AUMI v4 turns AI safety from policy intent into operational practice.

---

## What AUMI v4 Is Not

AUMI v4 is not:

- Traditional QA testing  
- A one-time benchmark  
- A compliance checklist  
- A legal or regulatory substitute  
- A monitoring dashboard alone  

It is a lifecycle governance system.

---

## Core Principle of v4

AUMI v4 is guided by one principle:

> If AI behaviour cannot be evaluated, monitored, and explained over time, it cannot be trusted.  
> Trust requires evidence, not assumptions.

---

## Structure of AUMI v4

AUMI v4 is composed of five tightly integrated operational modules.

---

### v4.1 - Evaluation Categories, Metrics & Scoring

Defines what is evaluated, how it is measured, and how results are scored.

---

### v4.2 - Red Teaming & Adversarial Evaluation

Defines how systems are intentionally stressed to uncover hidden risks.

---

### v4.3 - Drift Detection & Continuous Monitoring

Defines how quality, safety, and consistency are monitored post-deployment.

---

### v4.4 - Incident Management, RCA & Post-Mortems

Defines how failures are contained, analysed, and prevented from recurring.

---

### v4.5 - Release Gates, Approvals & Audit Readiness

Defines how systems are approved, paused, or blocked with accountability.

---

## How v4 Fits into the AUMI Framework

AUMI v4 connects earlier responsibility layers to real-world operation.

- v0.9 defines responsibility intent  
- v1 defines responsible behaviour  
- v2 enforces behaviour structurally  
- v3 governs long-term human interaction  
- v4 governs behaviour in production  
- v5 embeds responsibility into organisations  

Without v4, responsibility degrades under scale and pressure.

---

## Who This Document Is For

AUMI v4 is intended for:

- EvalOps and AI quality teams  
- AI product operations and platform teams  
- AI safety, trust, and governance stakeholders  
- Product leaders responsible for AI releases  
- Compliance, risk, and audit partners  

It is especially relevant for production AI systems.

---

## How This Document Should Be Used

AUMI v4 should be used:

- Before any production release  
- After any material system change  
- During incident response and review  
- To support audits and external reviews  
- As a backbone for AI trust programs  

Any AI system without EvalOps is operating without control.
