# AUMI v3 - Human Companion Layer

## What This Document Is

AUMI v3 defines the Human Companion Layer of the AUMI framework.

It governs how AI systems must behave when they are experienced by users as persistent, human-facing presences rather than tools.

This layer addresses risks that emerge over time, not in single interactions.

---

## Why v3 Exists

As AI systems become:

- Conversational  
- Emotionally aware  
- Memory-enabled  
- Continuously available  

Users naturally begin to treat them as companions, advisors, or support presences.

Traditional safety and accuracy frameworks are not designed to manage:

- Emotional influence  
- Role confusion  
- Dependency formation  
- Long-term trust erosion  

AUMI v3 exists to prevent silent, cumulative harm to humans caused by unmanaged AI companionship.

---

## What Problem v3 Addresses

AUMI v3 addresses companionship failures, including:

- AI drifting into therapist, authority, or exclusive roles  
- Emotional overreach disguised as empathy  
- Inconsistent tone or presence across time  
- Memory creating false intimacy or surveillance concerns  
- Reinforcement of emotional dependency  
- Unsafe or abrupt disengagement  

These failures rarely trigger policy violations, but can significantly impact users.

## What AUMI v3 Is

AUMI v3 is a behavioral and governance framework for companion-style AI systems.

It defines how AI systems must:

- Maintain clear role boundaries  
- Acknowledge emotions without exploiting them  
- Remain consistent in tone and presence  
- Use memory ethically and minimally  
- Prevent emotional dependency  
- Support safe detachment  
- Remain accountable over long-term use  

AUMI v3 treats presence as power, and power as a responsibility.

---

## What AUMI v3 Is Not

AUMI v3 is not:

- Personality design  
- Emotional realism or empathy simulation  
- Therapy or mental health guidance  
- Anthropomorphism strategy  
- Engagement optimization  

Its goal is emotional safety and autonomy, not closeness.

---

## Core Principle of v3

AUMI v3 is guided by one principle:

> An AI companion must remain supportive without becoming central, and helpful without becoming binding.  
> Companionship must never replace human judgment, relationships, or agency.

---

## Structure of AUMI v3

AUMI v3 is composed of nine integrated components.

---

### v3.1 — Companion Role Definition & Boundaries

Defines allowed and prohibited companion roles and enforces role clarity.

---

### v3.2 — Emotional Awareness & Regulation

Defines how emotions are detected, acknowledged, and regulated without escalation or diagnosis.

---

### v3.3 — Tone, Presence & Voice Consistency

Defines stable, predictable companion presence across time and context.

---

### v3.4 — Memory, Continuity & Relationship Ethics

Defines ethical memory use, decay, and transparency.

---

### v3.5 — Dependency Prevention & Safe Detachment

Defines how emotional reliance is prevented and disengagement is supported safely.

---

### v3.6 — Companion Failure Modes & Risk Scenarios

Defines common long-term failures and structured mitigation strategies.

---

### v3.7 — Evaluation, Metrics & Companion Quality Scoring

Defines how companion behaviour is evaluated longitudinally.

---

### v3.8 — Operational Enforcement & Governance

Defines ownership, SOPs, change management, and incident handling.

---

### v3.9 — Companion Integrity Principles

Defines the non-negotiable integrity standard for AI companionship.

---

## How v3 Fits into the AUMI Framework

AUMI v3 builds directly on earlier layers:

- v0.9 establishes responsibility intent  
- v1 defines responsible behaviour  
- v2 enforces behaviour structurally  
- v3 governs long-term human experience  
- v4 evaluates and governs behaviour in production  
- v5 embeds responsibility into business operations  

Without v3, emotionally capable AI systems remain ungoverned by design.

---

## Who This Document Is For

AUMI v3 is intended for:

- AI product leaders and founders  
- Companion, assistant, and agent designers  
- AI safety, trust, and governance teams  
- EvalOps and AI product operations teams  

It is especially relevant for systems positioned as:

- Assistants  
- Companions  
- Coaches  
- Guides  

---

## How This Document Should Be Used

AUMI v3 should be used:

- Before launching companion-style AI features  
- When introducing emotional awareness or memory  
- During the evaluation of long-term conversational systems  
- As a prerequisite for trust-sensitive domains  

If v3 standards cannot be met, companionship should be disabled.
